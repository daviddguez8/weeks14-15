# Weeks 14-15

In this lab assignment, we are going to practice using stacks and queues with binary trees. 
We hope you enjoy this assignment! Let’s get started!


## What is the scenario? 

In this lab, we are going to play with arithmetic expressions. 
You are going to use two main representations of arithmetic expressions: post-fix notation (see class notes for details on what post-fix notation is) and as binary trees (see class notes for details on what such binary trees are like).

You will use the post-fix notation to evaluate your expression.

You will use the binary tree representation to: 1/ evaluation your expression, 2/ print your expression in in-fix notation with parentheses, and 3/ traverse it in level-order fashion to gather the list of all of its values and variables.

## Let’s build data structures
For this, you are going to have to manipulate / design a few types. We are providing you with the following guidelines:
*	Post-fix notation of an arithmetic expression → represented by a string. You will define a type `PostfixExpression`.
*	Binary tree of an arithmetic expression → represented by a binary tree of data, called `ExpressionBT` that contains:
  * `String type`: can be `"var"`, `"value”`, or `"operator"`
  * `char operator`: can be `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/'`
  * `int value`
  * `String variable`: can be any identifier for a variable, e.g., `"x"`, `"y"`, `"z"`, `"x1"`, `"myVar"`.
  
Note: depending on what type contains, only one of the other 3 attributes will be relevant.

Let’s go over the details you will need to implement for each type. Note that we have provided you with the methods marked with a &dagger;.

### `PostfixExpression`
##### Private Attributes: 
* `String expression`&dagger;
#### Methods:
##### Constructors: 
* `PostfixExpression()`&dagger;
* `PostfixExpression(String e)`&dagger;
##### Accessors / getters:
* `getExpression()`&dagger;: returns expression string
##### Modifiers / setters:
* `setExpression(String newExpr)`&dagger;: assigns newExpr to expression
##### Other methods:
* `Evaluate()`: traverses the expression using IntStack and returns an integer: the integer value of the expression
* `Print()`: prints out the expression in postfix notation

### `ExpressionBT`
#### Private Attributes: 
* `String type`&dagger;
* `char operator`&dagger;
* `int value`&dagger;
* `String variable`&dagger;
* `ExpressionBT left`&dagger;
* `ExpressionBT right`&dagger;
#### Methods:
##### Constructors: 
* `ExpressionBT()`&dagger;
* `ExpressionBT(String[] e)`&dagger;
##### Accessors / getters:
* `getType()`&dagger;
* `getValue()`&dagger;
* `getVariable()`&dagger;
* `getLeft()`&dagger;
* `getRight()`&dagger;
##### Modifiers / setters:
* `setType(String t)`&dagger;
* `setValue(int v)`&dagger;
* `setVariable(String var)`&dagger;
* `setLeft(ExpressionBT b)`&dagger;
* `setRight(ExpressionBT b)`&dagger;
##### Other methods:
* `Evaluate()`: traverses the expression using recursion and returns an integer: the integer value of the expression. Note: only if there are no variables in the expression. If there are variables, print out that you cannot evaluate and return 0 
* `Print()`: prints out the expression in infix notation with parentheses, using a `BTStack`
* `allVariables()`: void method. It prints out all variables in the tree, if any. If there is no variable, it prints out `"no variable in this expression"`. This method should use a `BTQueue`.
* `includesVariables()`: returns true if the expression contains at least one variable, false otherwise

### Notes
To implement a few of the above methods, you will need to have a few additional types: 
* A stack of integers, called `IntStack`
* A stack of nodes (nodes that form your expression binary tree): `BTStack`
* A queue of nodes (nodes that form your expression binary tree): `BTQueue`

You are free to use any implementation you like of the above types, provided that they respect the following signatures of methods:
* For both stacks:
  * `Peek()`: returns the relevant content of the top element without removing it from the stack
  * `Pop()`: returns the top element and removes it from the stack
  * `Push(data d)`: adds d on top of the stack
* For the queue:
  * `Peek()`:returns the relevant content of the head element without removing it from the queue
  * `Dequeue()`: returns the top element and removes it from the queue
  * `Enqueue(data d)`: adds d to the tail of the queue
  
Note: You may have to implement additional methods such as: `isEmpty`, `isFull`, depending on your implementation choices.

Note: we provide you with:
*	Some code pertaining to `ExpressionBT.java`; 
*	Starter code for `PostfixExpression.java`; 
*	Starter code for `IntStack.java`;
*	Starter code for `BTStack.java`; and
*	Starter code for `BTQueue.java`.

You have to complete all of the above files by following the guidelines provided to you earlier in this document.
